# Quick Definiton
Calabash is a test automation framework that enables mobile developers and pretty much anyone without coding skills to create and execute automated acceptance tests for Android and iOS apps.

Calabash works by enabling automatic UI interactions within an application such as pressing buttons, inputting text, validating responses, etc. 

While this is a great first step in automated UI acceptance test automation, the real benefits can be gained when Calabash tests are executed on real mobile devices.
