# ionic-calabash
A simple guide to have running calabash test on a ionic project

### Quick Definiton
Calabash is a test automation framework that enables mobile developers and pretty much anyone without coding skills to create and execute automated acceptance tests for Android and iOS apps.

Calabash works by enabling automatic UI interactions within an application such as pressing buttons, inputting text, validating responses, etc. 

While this is a great first step in automated UI acceptance test automation, the real benefits can be gained when Calabash tests are executed on real mobile devices.



### Requiriments

Is recommend that you use the most recent released version of Xcode, MacOS, and Ruby.

MacOS 10.10 or 10.11

Xcode 7 or 8

iOS Devices >= 9.0

iOS Simulators >= 9.0

ruby >= 2.0 (latest is preferred)

### Quick Septup

Calabash requires Ruby to be installed on your machine. First, check whether you have Ruby installed on your machine:

##### Vim
```
# Some examples of various styles:
$ ruby -v
```

### There's a problem with the syntax highlighting of a file

#### Documentation

##### Vim
```
# Some examples of various styles:
vim: syntax=java
vim: set syntax=ruby:
